# plcc-noise-analyzer
The Noise Analyzer Simulation Tool is a Python-based project that models, analyzes, and visualizes the effect of noise on Power Line Carrier Communication (PLCC) systems. PLCC allows communication signals to travel over power lines, but these signals are often affected by mains hum (50 Hz), Gaussian noise, and impulse noise.
